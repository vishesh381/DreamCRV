# Modals Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->
## 2.25.1

### Updated

- Updated the modals blueprint to display a white background for the close button (X) to improve visibility for people with low vision. Specifically, we updated the close button (X) color from white to gray by removing the `slds-button_icon-inverse` class. To display the modal close button correctly, donâ€™t use the `slds-button_icon-inverse` class for your close button markup.
