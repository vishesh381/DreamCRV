# @locker/internal-policy

> Lightning Web Security Trusted LWS Policy

This package is meant to be only usable internally by `@locker` packages.

Signing Example:
```js
  import { lwsInternalPolicy } from '@locker/internal-policy'

  script.src = lwsInternalPolicy.createScriptURL('...');
```

NOTE: if polyfills are needed to support additional trustedTypes functionality, such as getAttributeType or getPropertyType, the code at https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/blob/main/src/trustedtypes.js is a great resource to get started.
