## Event.prototype.originalTarget

The read-only [`originalTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/originalTarget) property of the `Event` interface returns the original target of the event before any retargetings. Unlike `Event.prototype.explicitOriginalTarget` it can also be native anonymous content.

The Firefox only `originalTarget` property of an event object can be used by malicious code to gain cross-component access to elements.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion blocks access to `Event.prototype.originalTarget`.
