## Document.prototype.releaseCapture

The [`Document.prototype.releaseCapture()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/releaseCapture) method releases mouse capture if it's currently enabled on an element within this document. When mouse capture is released, mouse events are no longer directed to the element on which capture is enabled.

Malicious code can use the `releaseCapture` API for phishing attacks.
