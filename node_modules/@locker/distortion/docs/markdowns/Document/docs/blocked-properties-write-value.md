## Document.prototype.write

The [`Document.prototype.write()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write) method writes a string of text to a document stream opened by `document.open()`.

Malicious code can use `document.write` to write arbitrary JavaScript code directly into the document, which can bypass Lightning Web Security distortions and access the raw window.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion blocks access to `Document.prototype.write`.
