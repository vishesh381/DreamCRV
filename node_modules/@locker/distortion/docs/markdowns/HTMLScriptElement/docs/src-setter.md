## HTMLScriptElement.prototype.src setter

[`HTMLScriptElement.prototype.src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement) property is a `DOMString` representing the URL of an external script. It reflects the `src` attribute of the `script` element specifying the URL to an external script.

To ensure that JavaScript code loaded through a `script` element runs in the sandbox, Lightning Web Security evaluates the source text in the same sandbox before the browser evaluates it. This prevents the native behavior of the `script` element from triggering.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents a script from running before LWS can evaluate it.
