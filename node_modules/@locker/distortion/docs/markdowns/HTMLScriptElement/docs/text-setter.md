## HTMLScriptElement.prototype.text setter

The [`HTMLScriptElement.prototype.text`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement) is a string that joins and returns the contents of all Text nodes inside the <script> element (ignoring other nodes like comments) in tree order. On setting, it acts the same way as the textContent IDL attribute.

You can set `HTMLScriptElement.prototype.text` to replace DOM inside the element with nodes parsed from the given specified text as HTML.

Lightning Web Security runs in the main window, where the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements are shared. Malicious code can replace the DOM of those shared elements, corrupting the DOM of the current rendered page.

### Distorted Behavior

When setting the value of this property on a script element, this distortion will force the script to be evaluated in the sandbox that created the element.
