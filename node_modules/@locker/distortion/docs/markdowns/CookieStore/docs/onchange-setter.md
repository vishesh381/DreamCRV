## CookieStore.prototype.onchange setter

The [`CookieStore.prototype.onchange()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore/onchange) event handler of the `CookieStore` interface fires when a change is made to any cookie.

This distortion prevents code from accessing cookies outside of the sandbox.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support the `CookieStore.onchange` event, so setting the `onchange` property, or adding a `change` event listener is not allowed and throws an exception.
