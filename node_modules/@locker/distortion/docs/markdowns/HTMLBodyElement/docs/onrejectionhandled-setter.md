## HTMLBodyElement "rejectionhandled" event

The [rejectionhandled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/rejectionhandled_event) event is sent to the script's global scope (usually window but also Worker) whenever a rejected JavaScript Promise is handled late, such as when a handler is attached to the promise after its rejection had caused an `unhandledrejection` event.

This can be used in debugging and for general application resiliency, in tandem with the `unhandledrejection` event, which is sent when a promise is rejected but there is no handler for the rejection at the time.

The event object associated with the `rejectionhandled` event exposes a property called `reason`, which can contain sensitive information.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support setting the `onrejectionhandled` event handler or adding a `rejectionhandled` event listener; attempting to do so throws an exception.
