## HTMLBodyElement "storage" event

The [`storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/storage_event) event of the `Window` interface fires when a storage area (such as `localStorage`) has been modified in the context of another document.

The `storage` event object exposes `key`, `newValue`, `oldValue`, `storageArea` and `url` data, which can contain sensitive information.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support setting the `onstorage` event handler or adding a `storage` event listener; attempting to do so throws an exception.
