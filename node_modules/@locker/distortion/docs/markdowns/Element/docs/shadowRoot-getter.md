## Element.prototype.shadowRoot getter

The [`Element.prototype.shadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot) read-only property represents the shadow root hosted by the element.

This property allows retrieving the shadow DOM of custom elements created with `attachShadow({mode: 'open'})`.


### Distorted Behavior

This distortion returns `null` when you try to access an element's `shadowRoot` property from outside of the sandbox that it was created in. Elements or `shadowRoot` objects that are passed as function arguments are not protected.
