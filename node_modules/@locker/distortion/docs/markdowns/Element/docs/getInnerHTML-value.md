## Element.prototype.getInnerHTML

The `Element.prototype.getInnerHTML` property gets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element.

LWC's utilization of a synthetic shadow results in shadows that appear to be closed, but are actually open.

This distortion sets the `includeShadowRoots` option from `true` to `false`.
