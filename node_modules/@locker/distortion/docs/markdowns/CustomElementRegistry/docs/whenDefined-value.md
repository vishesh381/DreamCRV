## CustomElementRegistry.prototype.whenDefined

The [`whenDefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/whenDefined) method of the `CustomElementRegistry` interface returns a promise that fulfills when a new custom element of a given name is defined. 

Lightning Web Security controls the definition of custom elements by virtualizing the registry per sandbox to prevent usage of custom elements defined by system mode or others namespaces.

### Distorted Behavior

The promise will only be resolved for Custom Elements defined by the sandbox itself, and will never resolve for name defined by another sandbox or by the system.
