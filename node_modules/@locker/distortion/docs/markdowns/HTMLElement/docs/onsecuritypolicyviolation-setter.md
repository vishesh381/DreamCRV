## HTMLElement "securitypolicyviolation" event

The [securitypolicyviolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/securitypolicyviolation_event) event is fired when a Content Security Policy is violated.

The event is fired on the element that violates the policy and bubbles. It is normally handled by an event handler on the `Element`, `Document` or `Window` object.

The handler can be assigned using the `onsecuritypolicyviolation` property or using `EventTarget.addEventListener()`.

The event object associated with the `securitypolicyviolation` event exposes a property called `originalPolicy` which contains the `nonce` value. Malicious code with access to the `nonce` value can use it to bypass the Content Security Policy that determines whether a given script is allowed to proceed, and then run inline scripts.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support setting the `onsecuritypolicyviolation` event handler or adding a `securitypolicyviolation` event listener; attempting to do so throws an exception.
