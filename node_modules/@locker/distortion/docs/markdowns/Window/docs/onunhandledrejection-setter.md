## Window "unhandledrejection" event

The [unhandledrejection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unhandledrejection_event)  event is sent to the global scope of a script when a JavaScript Promise that has no rejection handler is rejected; typically, this is the window, but may also be a Worker.

This is useful for debugging and for providing fallback error handling for unexpected situations.

The event object associated with the `unhandledrejection` event exposes a property called `reason`, which can contain sensitive information.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support setting the `onunhandledrejection` event handler or adding a `unhandledrejection` event listener; attempting to do so throws an exception.
