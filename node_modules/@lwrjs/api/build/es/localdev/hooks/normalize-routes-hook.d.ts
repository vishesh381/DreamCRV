/**
 * This hook is run after the CLWR on start hook runs (which adds every route for the MRT bundle).
 * It then sets the LWR/LWC versions to the ones included in the bundle rather than use the default
 * versions from the LWR CLI. If CLWR starts including these by default we can remove this code.
 *
 * MRT bundle routes don't currently contain any version information in their bootstrap properties.
 * Local development needs to set the LWR/LWC versions on every route, otherwise, we will not
 * be able to resolve the loader shim or @lwc/* packages from the static bundle provider.
